# About
- This is the core resource the Golden State Fivem server used. Every line of code written by me!
- Lots of work and hours went into these. I no longer play or create FiveM mods, however, can help! This where I learned to code after all.
- Feel free to use it; do not resell it. Fork or make pull requests as needed.

- More will be added here in the near future, with more read me's.

Feel free to contact me with the info on my profile for any immediate concerns.
